Heart Disease prediction using machine learning classification techniques

We use multiple classification techqiues on the UCI heart data set and predict if a patient does have a heart disease or not.
Some of the classification techniques used are as follows :
  1) SVM
  2) Decision Tress
  3) Random Forest 
  4) KNN
  5) Naive Bayes
